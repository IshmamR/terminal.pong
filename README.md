# Terminal Ping Pong 🏓

A simple, fun ping pong game playable entirely in your terminal. Built with Rust and powered by [`ratatui`](https://crates.io/crates/ratatui) for a beautifully responsive TUI (Text User Interface).

Currently, you can play against a basic AI opponent, a friend locally, or just watch AI vs AI in screensaver mode. It's fast, minimal, and runs right inside your terminal window.

Now with a customizable settings screen: choose your favorite color theme and set default difficulty for each mode!
